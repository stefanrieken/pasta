# Like the 'args' syntax, 'loop' was born from a need to keep things simple,
# and it works surprisingly well: the block argument is repeated until it
# returns a false value (0).


# This acts like a 'do ... while' loop:

define "i" 1;
loop {
    print i;
    set "i" (+ 1 i);
    <= i 10
}

# This takes in a second block, to act like a 'while' loop:

set "i" 1;
loop {<= i 10} {
    print i;
    set "i" (+ i 1)
}

# This does the same, without requiring the double block syntax:

set "i" 1;
loop {
    if (<= i 10) {
        print i;
        set "i" (+ i 1);
        return true
    }
}

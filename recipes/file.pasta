# Write (full) initial state to file
save "test.ram"

# Prove a point by clearing tile memory
define "i" 0
loop {
    setb 0x6000 i 0;

# Then read data again
load "test.ram"

# To show that data has magically returned,
# run e.g. ./tricolore recipes/file.pasta recipes/hello.trico
# Comment out the 'load' instruction to verify the difference.
